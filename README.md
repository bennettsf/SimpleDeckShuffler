# Simple Card Deck Shuffler
This simple script creates a deck (array) of card objects, and allows you to shuffle the cards with the provided buttons.
For my random shuffle button I use the Fisherâ€“Yates shuffle function for best results
The other two buttons will place the cards in ascending/descending order based on the index number of the card object.
Each card object is given an index number from 1-13 based on the rank (Ace-King) of the card object with 1 = Ace and 13 = King
